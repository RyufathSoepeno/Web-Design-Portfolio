			<p>Wolves are not wild dogs! Although wolves and dogs share a common ancestor 
			and many characteristics, they are classified as different animals: Canis lupus (the gray wolf) 
			and Canis lupus familiaris (the domestic dog). Wolves and dogs each have many subspecies or breeds.</p>
			
			<p>The most important difference between wolves and dogs is that 
			wolves are wild. Kathryn Lord, an evolutionary biologist, says “If
			you want to socialize a dog with a human or a horse, all you need is 90 minutes 
			to introduce them between the ages of four and eight weeks. After that, a dog will 
			not be afraid of humans or whatever else you introduced. But with a wolf pup, 
			even close to the same fear reduction requires 24-hour contact starting before age 
			three weeks, and even then you won’t get the same attachment or lack of fear."</p>
			
			<p>Wolves and dogs also have different physical characteristics. Wolves have 
			larger heads, pointier snouts, thicker teeth, and longer legs.<p>
